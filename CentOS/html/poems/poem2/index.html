<h1>Bear In There</h1>
<img id="bearPic" src="bear.png" alt="A Mercer Bear">
<span class="firstLine">There's a Polar <span class="keyword">Bear</span></span><br>
In our Frigidaire--<br>
He likes it 'cause it's cold in there.<br>
With his seat in the meat<br>
And his face in the fish<br>
And his big hairy paws<br>
In the buttery dish,<br>
He's nibbling the noodles,<br>
He's munching the rice,<br>
He's slurping the soda,<br>
He's licking the ice.<br>
And he lets out a roar<br>
If you open the door.<br>
And it gives me a scare<br>
To know he's in there--<br>
That Polary <span class="keyword">Bear</span><br>
In our Fridgitydaire.
